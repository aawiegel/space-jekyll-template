I am an aspiring data scientist in the San Francisco Bay Area.

### My Background

I originally came from a background in physical chemistry/chemical physics where I studied the reaction rates of various chemical processes in the atmosphere. During my PhD and postdoctoral research, I steadily became interested and involved in programming, data analysis, and computer simulations to the point that I decided to switch careers to data science. My interests are not just limited to the atmosphere or chemistry, however. I am also interested in economics and finance, craft beer, running, education, and criminal justice.
